# Howdy! I'm Cam

These repositories are fun side-projects worked on in my spare time to stave off boredom.

If you find any of them useful, please let me know.

## Interests

- Templating systems (Jinja2 and those built to emulate it)
- Tooling (Parameterizing/formalizing the jank)
- Configuration Management (Primarily Ansible)
- Backend (Django, FastAPI, or Flask. In no particular order.)
- Tinkering with digital electronics and 8 bit computers

## Strong Opinions

A non-exhaustive list of my strong opinions, with context:

- Markup language preference. In order of least to most painful.
  - YAML. I don't care if it says it's not a 'markup language'. 
  - TOML. A close second, better than YAML in certain cases.
  - ... (most others)
  - XML
- Building custom solutions to already solved problems Should be avoided. However, there are a few valid reasons for doing so.
  - If it's for fun. To see if you can.
  - I it's for education. To learn how it's done.
  - If your boss tells you to and won't take no for an answer. To save your job.
- Documentation can be fun, but only when certain conditions are met:
  - If it's not tedious. So you don't burn out.
  - If you're not already sick of the project. Because you're already burnt out.
- The best editor is the one that gives you the least resistance.
  - Learning to use your editor's features properly is important to your goals.
  - Some editors have a better chance at giving you the lowest possible resistance.
  - Personal taste is still valid.
- PowerShell is a good scripting language.
  - Having actual declarable types goes a long way.
  - The Verb-Noun naming convention had a profound impact on the way I name things in other languages.
  - Piping objects into other objects (and accessing the pipelined object properties in C dot-notation) isn't seen enough elsewhere.
